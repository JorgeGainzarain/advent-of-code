# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Each day's challenge is divided into two parts, and the solutions are implemented in JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by years and by days inside, with each day having its own directory. Each directory contains two solution files (`part_1.js` and `part_2.js`) and two data files (`data.txt` and `test_data.txt`).

```
2024/
  ├── day1/
  │   ├── part_1.js
  │   ├── part_2.js
  │   ├── data.txt
  │   └── test_data.txt
  ├── day20/
  │   ├── part_1.js
  │   ├── part_2.js
  │   ├── data.txt
  │   └── test_data.txt
  └── ...
  └── day25/
      ├── part_1.js
      ├── part_2.js
      ├── data.txt
      └── test_data.txt
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/JorgeGainzarain/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024

2. Install the dependencies:
   npm install

## Running the Solutions

Each part of the challenge can be run independently. Navigate to the directory of the day you want to run and execute the corresponding JavaScript file using Node.js.

For example, to run `2024:day1`:
```sh
npm run 2024:day1
```

To run `2024:day5`:
```sh
npm run 2024:day5
```

And the same for other days and other years.

## Testing

Each part includes test data and real input data. The results for both are printed to the console when the script is executed.
